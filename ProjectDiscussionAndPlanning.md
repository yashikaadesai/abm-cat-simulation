1. We are going to make sure to communicate well with each other! If encountering a problem, make sure to ask questions and we will all work through it together. We should also accomodate everyone's schedules.

2. We are using Discord to communicate when not in-person. We will also check-in in-person once a week to set up tasks for everyone and see where we're at.

3. We will create a to do list for everyone, and also create descriptive commit messages so we are all up to date with what is going on and what has been added to the project. Let everyone know when you've pushed.

4. Our overall goals for this project are to create an accurate and efficient model that shows cat behavior. To meet these goals, we will work together as a group to continually make progress on our project. We will ask questions when needed and create realistic goals for ourselves to keep track with.
